Program Description:
This program uses three different file. These file are Gui2048.java,
Board.java, and Direction.java. The file Gui2048.java creates a visual
interface that allows the user the play the game 2048. Board.java is 
used to guide the behavior of the interface from Gui2048.java. Lastly,
Direction.java allows the game to move in the different directions that

Short Response:
1. For all instances:
       :%s/fun/amazing/g
   First intance of each line:
       :s%/fun/amazing/

2. mkdir -p fooDir/barDir
3. rm file.java
   When you use the wildcard "rm" it removes the file
   called immediately after it
4. :tab ball
5. The static keyword means that you can call that method
   without using an object to call it

   Example:
   static void doSomething() { }
   
   // in your main method
   doSomething();

6. First you should create seperate java files for the various shapes that
   you want to write. For example, just create files for circle and square.
   Then in each shape file you should create a constructor for that takes 
   color parameter. Using you constructor you should create that shape, and
   with the color parameter, set the color of your shape within the
   constructor.
